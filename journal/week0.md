# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
# I was able to complete the required assignment without any challenegs.
# I created an Architectual Diagram in Lucid Charts which showed the connection between a  Network Access Control List (NACL) and Security Group

# The NACL is responsible for filtering traffic in and out of the public subnet before it reach the security group. If access is allowed into the security group then clients can have access to resources such as EC2 instances.
